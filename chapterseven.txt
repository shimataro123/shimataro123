                                                                            CHAPTER 7 OF PYTHON - FILE INPUT AND OUTPUT






Python can be used to perform operations on a file. 

Types of all files- 

1) Text Files = .txt .docx .log etc...
2) Binary Files = .mp4 .mov .png .jpeg etc...

        TOP OPEN , READ AND CLOSE FILES

We have to open a file before reading/writing

f = open("file_name" , "mode")

file_name can be a sample.text or demo.docx

mode can be r:read mode and w:write mode

by default it is set to read mode



data = f.read()
f.close()

'r' open for reading (default)
'w' open for writing, truncating the file first
'x' create a new file and open it for writing
'a' open for writing , appending to the end of the file if it exists
'b' binary mode
't' text mode (default)
'+' open a disk file for updating (reading and writing) 

Reading a file- 

1) data = f.read()

reads entire file

2) data = f.readline()

reads one line at a time


Writing to a file 

f = open("sample.text" , "w")
f.write("I hope I die")

this will delete the previous text and print the new one

to add a a text to existing file 

instead of "w" type "a"

this will add the text 

use \n to write it in the next line

f = open("sample.text" , "a")

f.write("\n I love from friends and family. They are the best. I hope everyone is doing their best and achieve what they wish to.")

r+ overwrites the line but in the starting



WITH SYNTAX- 

with open ("sample.txt", "a") as f: 
    data = f.read()

as - this means nothing but allias which is "another name for"



     DELETING A FILE 

using the os module

Module (like a code library) is a file written by another programmer than generally has a function we can use

import os
os.remove(filename)  

and we can delete the file
