                                                                             CHAPTER 5 OF PYTHON- LOOPS





Loops are used to repeat instructions. 

loops are of two types- while and for 

While loops will hold true until when the condition is true

Example- 

count= 1
while count <= 8:
print ("Hello Guys. I hope you all are doing good. Remember that dawn always follows dusk.")
count +=1 

and this will print 
("Hello Guys. I hope you all are doing good. Remember that dawn always follows dusk.")

9 times


          QUESTIONS

Q) Print numbers from 1 to 100

Ans) count = 1
     while count <=100:
     print (count)
     count += 1

Q) Print numbers from 100 to 1

Ans) count = 100
while count >= 1:
        print(count)
        count -= 1

Q) Print a multiplication table of a number n

Ans)
n=int(input("Enter number :  "))

 a= 1
while a <=10:
    print(n*a)
    a+=1


BREAK AND CONTINUE

Break- used to terminate the loop when encountered

Example- 

a= 1
while a <=5:
    print(a)
    if(a==3):
        break
    a+=1

And the loop stops at 3

giving 
1
2
3

Continue- terminates execution in the current iteration and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration.

Example- 

i=0
while i<=5:
    if(i==3):
        i+=1
        continue
    print(i)
    i+=1


so the job of print is to skip that part and continue with the rest


      FOR LOOPS

For loops are used for sequential traversal. For traversing list,string,tuples etc.

for loops

for el in list: 

list = {1,2,3}
for el in list: 
print(el) 

el is elements

so print(3) will give us 3 from that list 

Another example - 

classes = ["one", "two", "three", "four" ]

for val in classes: 
print(val)


           QUESTIONS 

Q) Print the elements of the following list using a loop: 
[1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]

Ans) nums = [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]

for val in nums:
    print(val)


Q) Search for a number x in this tuple using loop:
[1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]

Ans) nums= (1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100)
x=49

idx=0
for el in nums:
    if(el==x):
        print("number found at idx", idx)
    
    idx+=1

                    Range


range()- Range functions return a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

range(start,stop,step)

print(range(7))

will give us 
(0,7)

for val in range(7):
    print(val)

this will give us all the numbers from 0 to 6 individually 

for between 2 numbers we can code

for i in range (4,11): 
    print(i)

if we write like (2,10,2): 
    this will start from 2 increase  by 2 and stop at 9 

Example- 

for a in range (3,25,2):
    print(a)

will give us 
3
5
7
9
11
13
15
17
19
21
23


Q) Print the multiplication table of a number n. 

Ans) n = int(input("Enter your number : "))

for i in range (1,11):
    print(n*i) 

and this gives us 
22
44
66
88
110
132
154
176
198
220


           PASS STATEMENT
Pass is a null statement that does nothing. It is used as  a placeholder for future code.

for el in range(10):
    pass


Exmaple- for z in range(10):
    pass

and now the code will be correct

it basically does nothing but we cannot leave this place empty so we use this


Q) Write a program to find the sum of n natural numbers. 

Ans) n=10

sum= 0
for a in range (1,n+1):
    sum +=a

print("Total sum : ", sum)
