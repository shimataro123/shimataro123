Functions

Block of statements that perform a specific task.

We usually write functions to avoid writing multiple times the same lines of code

Example - 

If we need to find the sum of two numbers say a and b 

instead of doing the usual way of writing 
a=4
b= 5

sum(a+b)
print(sum)

and then writing a and b again but with different numbers we do this - 


def find_sum(a,b):
    sum = a+b
    print(sum)
    return sum 


and now we can put any variables - 

find_sum (5,10)

find_sum (12,19)

find_sum (14,1)

and this will give those answers

There are 2 types of functions- 

1) Built-in functions - 

print()
len()
type()
range()

if you want 2 statements to be printed on the same line write end = " " 


2) User defined functions-
The functions which we build are called user defined functions

Default parameters-

Assigning a default value to parameter, which is used when no argument is passed.

Example- 

def cal_sum (a=4 , b=5):
    print (a+b)
    return a+b


cal_sum()


for writing all the strings in one line we can either use 

print(list)

but this comes with ""

so we can instead define the function as 

def print_list(list):
    for item in list:
        print(item, end = " " )

and now we can call our function 

print_list(list) 


and this will give us all the items in 1 line 

Example - 

ruits = ("apple", "mango", "banana", "gauva" , "orange" , "lichi")

print(len(fruits))

def print_list(fruits):
    for item in fruits:
        print(item , end = " ")

print_list(fruits)


and the result is 

apple mango banana gauva orange lichi





          RECURSION- 

When a function calls itself repeatedly 


this is basically just a more advanced version of loops

Example - 

def show (n): 
    if (n==0):
        return
    print(n)
    show(n-1)

show(7)
