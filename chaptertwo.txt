                                                               CHAPTER 2 OF PYTHON - STRINGS AND CONDITONAL STATEMENTS




                  STRINGS

Strings can be stored either by ' ' or " " or """ """ 
All three of them are valid but we use " " 

Example - 

str1 = 'This is a string'
str2 = "This is Krish" 
str3 = """This is my code"""

To write 2 strings in two different lines we can use "\n"

str4= "This is Krish. \n I like playing cricket"
and now if we run this code it will print it in the next line.

"\n" is known as escape sequence character

"\t" will provide with a tab of space 

str5= "This is Krish. \t I like playing cricket"


BASIC OPERATION ON STRING

1)Concatenation- "hello" + "world" = "helloworld"

Example- 
         str1= "You"
         str2= "Tube"

         print(str1+str2)

2)len- this helps us to know the length of the string

Example- 

str1 = "You"
len1= len(str1)
print(len1)

str2= "Tube"
len2= len(str2)
print(len2)

and the answers will be 3 and 4 respectively

Indexing= this means allotting numbers to each character, which helps us to access characters

KRISH_JAIN WOULD BE 12345678 with KRISH_JAIN respectively

and the code to check this would be 

str= "Krish_jain"
ch= str[3]
print(ch) and this can be accessed directly as well

str = "Krish_jain"
print(str[3]) 

and this would give us S

Slicing  - accessing parts of a string 

the starting will be included but the ending wont be included 

Example- 

str = "Rakazaka" 

str [ 1:4 ]

now do 
print(str[1:4])
is "aka"

in python assigning numbers can be done in negative as well

Exmaple - 

School -6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1 respectively 

str = ("School")
print(str[-5:-1])

will give us choo

negative ones help in AI-ML

String functions 

1) .ends with 

Lets take a str= "I like playing cricket"
print(str.endswith("et"))

if it ends with er then it will show true or else false

2) .capitalize = this capitalizes the first letter of the string 

example - 

str= "i like playing cricket"
print(str.capitalize())

and on running the code it will capitalize the first letter

3) .replace(old,new)

this replaces the old value with some new value 

str = "I like my friends"
print(str.replace("i","e"))

print(str.replace ("friends", " a few people"))

4) .find(word) this finds the word and gives us its starting index

str = "I like my friends"
print(str.find("o"))

if something doesn't exist it will show -1

5) .count()- this counts the occurrence of the substring

str= "I love my friends"
print(str.count("I"))


NESTING IS if under if there is another if

Example - 

if (age>=18):
if (age>=80):
print ("cannot drive")

else:
print("can drive")


so the code will be 
age= int(input("type your age :"))
if(age >=18):
    if(age >=80):
        print("cannot drive")


PROJECT

Q) Write a program to check if a number entered is even or odd

Ans) num= int(input("type your number :"))

rem= num%2

if(rem==0):
    print("EVEN")
else:
    print("ODD")

Q) Write a program to find the greatest of 3 numbers entered by the user.

Ans) a= int(input("Type your numeber: "))
b= int(input("Type your number : "))
c= int(input("Type your number: "))

if(a>b and a>c):
    print("A is the largest")
elif(b>c):
    print("B is the second largest")
else:
    print("C is the largest")


a= int(input("Type your numeber: "))
b= int(input("Type your number : "))
c= int(input("Type your number: "))


if(a>b and a>c):
    print("A is the largest")
elif(b>a and b>c):
    print("B is the largest")
else:
    print("C is the largest")
